1. As a user, I would like to click on a search result item, so that the associated lessons will be added to my cart.

1. As a user, I would like remove lessons from my cart, so that I can my mind about which lessons I want to purchase.

## Optional Functionality

- As a user, I would like to avoid duplicating lessons in my cart, so I am not buying something that I don't need.

- As a user, I would like to see the details of the lessons being offered in a day/time search result prior to adding them to my cart (indicating lessons currently already in the cart), so I have more information about what I'm selecting.

- As a user, I would like the ability to filter the schedule search results based on one or more of the following items, so that I can easily narrow down the results.
  - Day(s) of the week
  - Time Range: Morning 8-12, Afternoon 12-4, Evening 4-9
  - Instructor gender preference from a student _(Only time blocks which include a lesson for both students after the filter is applied should be visible)_
